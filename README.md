# Binary-Search

1st Method that we are using here is iterative method
define variables as low , high and mid 
here in tterative method we will calculate the mid and checck if
**mid==target element return mid;
**mid <=target move low=mid+1;
**else mid>=target high=mid-1;

Inside main function 
** Declare the value of array
** calculate the size of the array by sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]);
** Call the function and store the value in a variable result now check if result is -1 
** if yes then return element not found 
  else return result;
